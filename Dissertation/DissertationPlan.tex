\chapter{Introduction}

\pagenumbering{arabic}

Describe project aims

\section{Motivation}

Discuss uses for sound separation and need for this solution

Mention Hadamard's conditions and ill-posed problem

\section{Overview of Sound Separation}

Describe forms of sound separation

Specify parameters of problem being considered and explain why

Published literature - following work of J. Bloggs

\section{Current Implementations}

Say what Melodyne does and other music-oriented piece

Beamforming?

\section{Overview of the Dissertation (Optional)}

Sentence on each section of the dissertation

\chapter{Preparation}

Brief statement about design choices

\section{Choice of Overall Process}

Describe general flow of data through solution + reasons

Alternative(s) - no features?

Comment on human process

\section{Choice of Features}

Define sinusoidal trajectories

NMF and matrix factors

Other possible feature?

STFT vs Wavelets

\section{Choice of Implementation}

Mention typical code examples (i.e. MATLAB)
